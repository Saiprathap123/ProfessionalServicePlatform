# Action Required: Update Brevo Credentials and Test Appointment Email Functionality

---

## 1. Update Your SMTP Credentials

Replace your existing Brevo credentials in your `.env` or Render/Replit environment variables with:

```
BREVO_USER=brevouser
BREVO_PASS=brevopass
```
- No quotes or extra spaces.
- Save and restart the backend service after any credential update.

---

## 2. Confirm Proper Integration

- Ensure your email sending logic is referencing these updated environment variables:
    - In Nodemailer config:
      ```
      auth: {
        user: process.env.BREVO_USER,
        pass: process.env.BREVO_PASS
      }
      ```
- The SMTP host should remain as `smtp-relay.brevo.com` and port `587`[2][3][6].

---

## 3. Test the Booking System

- Make a test appointment booking through the platform.
- Watch your Replit/Render logs for:
    - Confirmation that email was sent successfully (no authentication or credential errors).
    - If transport verification is enabled in your code, expect a log similar to:  
      `SMTP authenticated successfully, ready to send mail.`
- Both the user (booking email) and client/admin should receive the notification and confirmation emails containing all appointment details and the meeting link.

---

## 4. If There Are Errors

- If any authentication or "missing credentials" error occurs, double-check:
  - The values in `.env` (no typos, no invisible characters).
  - That you are restarting the backend after changes[2][3][6][9].
- If authentication fails, regenerate a new SMTP password in the Brevo dashboard and update `.env` again.
- Ensure that the Brevo sender (`recruitment@dynish.com` or your preferred sender) is verified in the Brevo dashboard.

---

## 5. Final Checks

- Confirm successful delivery to both user and client emails.
- If using an alternative notification address for the client/admin, update the recipient in the backend as needed.
- Log both the backend result and check inbox/spam folders of user and client mailboxes for the test email.

---

Once the updated credentials are in place and the backend is restarted, the full appointment notification workflow should be functional. Proceed to live testing and confirm successful email delivery to both parties[2][3][6][9].

# Action Required: Update Brevo Credentials and Test Appointment Notifications

---

## 1. Update Brevo SMTP Credentials

**Set these exact values in your `.env` or environment variables:**
```
BREVO_USER=brevouser
BREVO_PASS=brevopass
```
- Ensure there are **no quotes or extra spaces** in the `.env` file.
- Save changes and **fully restart your backend/server** so the updated credentials take effect.

---

## 2. Test the Booking Functionality

- Submit a test appointment using the siteâ€™s booking form.

**Upon successful booking:**
- The user (booking email) should receive a confirmation email.
- The client/admin (`Recruitment@Dynish.com`) should receive a notification with booking details and the meet link.

**If any issues:**
- Check server logs for authentication or delivery errors.
- If authentication fails, confirm there are no typos and that the credentials are not expired or revoked in Brevo.
- Ensure the sender domain is verified and authenticated in Brevo for best deliverability[3][5][6][8].

---

## 3. Email Delivery Troubleshooting

- Monitor your backend logs for the message:
  - `SMTP authenticated successfully, ready to send mail.` (or similar success message)
  - If you see authentication errors (e.g., `535 5.7.8 Authentication failed`), regenerate your SMTP key in the Brevo dashboard and repeat the steps above.
- If emails are sent but not received, check spam/junk or use another test recipient.

## 4. Summary Table

| Step                | Action                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Update `.env`       | Use provided Brevo credentials        |
| Restart server      | Ensure new env vars are loaded        |
| Test booking        | Submit form; verify user & admin emails|
| Debug errors        | Check Brevo, sender verification, logs|

---

Once you confirm booking email delivery works for both user and admin addresses, your configuration is complete.
